    <p>Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.</p>
    <p>Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.</p>
    <p>Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the "Happy Birthday" song from beginning to end twice.</p>
    <p>Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.</p>
    <p>Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.</p>
